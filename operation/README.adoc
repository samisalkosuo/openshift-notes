This document describes how to do various operational tasks in OpenShift.

== Upgrade airgapped OpenShift

Upgrading airgapped OpenShift requires mirroring of updated images from Internet and then moving them to mirror registry in airgapped environment.

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/updating/updating-restricted-network-cluster.html[Upgrade in airgapped environment is documented].

This assumes that OpenShift was installed using instructions in this repository so there is a mirror registry in the bastion server.

* Determine new version:
** Check OpenShift versions: https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/.
** Go to directory of desired OpenShift version.
** View _release.txt_ file and verify that desired version can upgrade existing version.
*** For example: https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/4.6.7/release.txt[v4.6.7 can upgrade v4.6.1].
* Login to jump server.
* Edit link:../config.sh[config.sh] and set _OCP_VERSION_ to the desired version.
** Source new configuration: `source config.sh`
* Create mirror-package that includes images of the new OpenShift version:
** `sh omg.sh create-mirror-package`
** Images are downloaded and tar file is created. 
*** Tar file name example: _mirror-images-4.6.7.tar_.
* Login to bastion server.
* Login to ocp as cluster admininstrator.
* Set _OCP_VERSION_ to the correct version in -config.sh_.
* Upload images to mirror registry:
** `sh omg.sh upload-mirror-package`
** Command extract mirror image tar file, pushes images to image registry and applies the mirrored release image signature config map to OpenShift cluster.
* After command completes, an upgrade command is printed. For example:
** `oc adm upgrade --allow-explicit-upgrade --to-image mirror-registry.forum.fi.ibm.com:5000/ocp/openshift4@sha256:6ddbf56b7f9776c0498f23a54b65a06b3b846c1012200c5609c4bb716b6bdcdf`
* Optionally verify that images are in the registry:
** `curl -u admin:passw0rd https://mirror-registry.forum.fi.ibm.com:5000/v2/ocp/openshift4/tags/list | jq`
* Execute command to start OpenShift upgrade.
* Upgrade takes a moment...
* Monitor upgrade process by any of the following:
** OpenShift web console:
*** _Administration -> Cluster Settings_.
** `oc adm upgrade`
** `oc get clusteroperators`
** `oc get nodes`


== Add worker node

== Remove worker node

== Dedicate router nodes

== Backup etcd

See backup instructions in docs https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.html.

* Script link:backup/backup_etcd.sh[backup_etcd.sh] backs up etcd as described in documentation.
* Backup files are copied to local directory.
* Move files to location that is safe if disaster occurs.

== Restore etcd
