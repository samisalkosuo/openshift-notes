= OpenShift installation on user-provisioned infrastructure - airgapped
:toc: left
:toc-title: Table of Contents

This directory includes scripts to install OpenShift on user-provisioned infrastructure in airgapped environment.

On-premise infrastructure can be bare metal, or virtualized servers. Everything here is based on OpenShift documentation about airgapped installation, for example https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-restricted-networks-bare-metal.html[Installing a cluster on bare metal in a restricted network].

The idea behind this repo and these scripts is to provide quick install of OpenShift with minimal external dependencies.

The helper script link:omg-upi-airgapped.sh[omg-upi-airgapped.sh] has commands to setup DNS, DHCP, Load balancer and others that support OpenShift and enable quick install with minimal external dependencies.

== Requirements

* A jump server with access to Internet to download all required software.
** Preferrably a RHEL-based Linux server.
* Bastion host, preferrably a RHEL-based Linux server. 
** Installation (and administration) is done from this bastion.
* NOTE: jump server and bastion must be the same Linux distribution and version, preferrably installed from the same ISO-file (for example https://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/8/isos/x86_64/Rocky-8.4-x86_64-minimal.iso[Rocky Linux 8.4 minimal installation ISO-file]).
* Access to airgapped infrastructure to create servers, bare metal or virtual servers.
** There must be enough resources to install OpenShift and any workloads on top of it.

== Prepare

Before installing OpenShift, prepare yourself. Airgapped installation requires a bit more preparation than online installations. 

There are three major steps when doing airgapped installation:

* Download and package all required software using a jump server.
* Move downloaded packages to a bastion server.
* Install OpenShift in airgapped environment from the bastion server.

Follow the sections below to do the first major step.

* Login to jump server as root.
* Clone or download this repo.
* https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads[Download _pull-secret.json_ from Red Hat].
* Set the following environment variables in link:upi-environment.sh[upi-environment.sh]:
** _OCP_PULL_SECRET_FILE_, _OCP_VERSION_, _OCP_RHCOS_MAJOR_RELEASE_ and _OCP_RHCOS_VERSION_
** All other variables are set later in the bastion host.
** Source variables: 
** `source upi_environment.sh`
* Execute helper script,`sh omg-upi-airgapped.sh`, to see help.


== Install prereqs and download clients and OpenShift images

* Install prereq packages (like DHCP) and useful tools:
** `sh omg-upi-airgapped.sh install-prereqs`
* Download and install required clients/tools like _oc_, _openshift-install_, _coredns_, etc.:
** `sh omg-upi-airgapped.sh download-clients`
* Download OpenShift images:
** `sh omg-upi-airgapped.sh download-ocp-images`
** If there are any errors, delete images directory and execute the command again.


== Distribution package

* Create distribution package containing RHCOS, images and others:
** `sh omg-upi-airgapped.sh create-dist-package`
** The command creates _dist.tar_ file.

== Copy/move distribution package

* Copy/move _dist.tar_ to airgapped bastion.
** Use root home directory.

== Prepare airgapped bastion

* Login to bastion.
* Extract _dist.tar_:
** `tar -xf dist.tar`
** Go to extracted directory _ocp-dist_.
* Edit environment variables link:upi-environment.sh[upi-environment.sh]
** Add correct domain using _OCP_DOMAIN_-variable.
* Source environment variables:
** `source upi-environment.sh`
** Environment variables are further modified later.
* Create _pull-secret.json_:
** `touch $OCP_PULL_SECRET_FILE`
** This pull secret is populated and used later during mirroring.
* Create local repository:
** `sh omg-upi-airgapped.sh create-local-repo`
* Install prereq packages from local repository:
** `sh omg-upi-airgapped.sh install-prereqs-bastion`
** Copies also client binaries to /usr/local/bin.
** Loads also container images.
* Create mirror registry:
** `sh omg-upi-airgapped.sh create-mirror-registry`
** CA certificate and  mirror registry certificate are created and CA added to local trust.
*** Directory _/root/ocp-certificates_.
** Mirror registry name is `mirror-registry`
** `127.0.0.1 mirror-registry.$OCP_DOMAIN` is added to /etc/hosts.
** Systemd service named `mirror-registry` is created.
*** `systemctl status mirror-registry`
* Upload OpenShift images to mirror registry:
** `sh omg-upi-airgapped.sh upload-ocp-images`


== Install OpenShift

Install OpenShift by following xref:README_UPI_online.adoc[README_UPI_online] and starting from _Create servers_.
