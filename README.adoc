The architecture of OpenShift in the context of this repository.

* The architecture displays a typical UPI airgapped environment.
** UPI online environment is the same except that there is access from internal network to Internet.
** IPI architecture is similar.
* Jump server is the one used to download OpenShift images and other software.
** Files from jump server are transferred to bastion.
* Bastion server is the one that is used to install/manage OpenShift environment.
* Bastion may include other supporting services like DHCP.
** All the services could be in dedicated servers.
* Load balancer is http://gobetween.io/[Gobetween] in this context.
** Some other load balancer can be also used.
** Load balancer external host name(s) must be accessible from OpenShift internal network.
* Bastion may include optional services like LDAP and NFS.
* Storage can be NFS, VSphere, local disks, or other solution.
** Storage in this context is https://www.openshift.com/products/container-storage/[Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation].
* Two worker nodes are labeled so that ingress router will run on those nodes.
