The architecture of OpenShift in the context of this repository. Just a few comments about it:

* Architecture shows an airgapped environment, but it can be made online environment by adding a gateway from internal OCP network to network with external access.
* Jump server is the one used to download OpenShift images and other software.
** Files from jump server are transferred to bastion.
* Bastion server is the one that is used to install/manage OpenShift environment.
* Bastion also includes all supporting services like DHCP.
** All the services could be in dedicated servers, if so desired.
* Load balancer is HAProxy in this environment.
** Some other load balancer can be also used.
** Load balancer external host name(s) must be accessible from OpenShift internal network.
* LDAP and NFS in bastion are used in this environment to provide those services.
** In real life, LDAP would be enterprise LDAP somewhere and NFS would be a typical enterprise storage solution.
** Or storage could be https://www.openshift.com/products/container-storage/[Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage].
* Two worker nodes are labeled so that ingress router will run on those nodes.
